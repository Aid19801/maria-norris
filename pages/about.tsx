            If you <i>really</i> want to get a feel what the content is like,
            it's influenced by the comedic stylings of Marina Hyde and Tim
            Dillon - after an assault by, I dunno, Christ, maybe... campaigning
            journalists like Raphael Behr and Ian Dunt.

            The first launch by <i>Funk-27</i> was the explosive "Aid Thompsin &
            Other Disappointments" podcast. The show began in December 2020 with
            its first guest, Emmett Short, and took the form of a weekly Tech,
            Comedy & Dystopia conversation. "What will Crypto do to the Finance
            industry?" feat Tom Pontin, or "What does the future of UX [user
            experience] look like?", and so on. <br />
            <br />
            But as the Pandemic took hold and reality began to resemble the
            dystopias we'd read about in Science Fiction novels, the worlds of
            Science, Politics and Tech began to align. And so the show has
            broadened out to find-the-funny in (or merely examine) areas like
            Brexit, Tory Government, the Trumpification of the Republican Party
            and/or the changing shape and influence of Media in the 21st
            Century.
